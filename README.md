# Weather-Dashboard
An interactive site that calls up weather api's globally.

Enter a city in the "Search for a City" 'City Name' Search bar.

If the city is recognized, it will populate the City/Country in a list underneath the Search bar as well as populate data to the right of the window. The data populated to the right, consists of:
 - The full City/Country name and current date
 - Humidity
 - Wind Speed
 - UV Index
 - 5-Day Forecast

If the city is not recognized, a prompt will pop up noting that the city name plus a country code separated by a comma should be used.

A user can click on any of the already saved city list to recall the forecast data.
